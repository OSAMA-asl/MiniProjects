**********************************************4.7.25****************************************************Today we had our first touches with the raspberry pi, after reading some of the manuals we figured out that we will need an sd card for boot, we can do it with an USB but the best option is to boot it on an microSD card chip and then mount an SSD nvme on it so we get the best preformance and speed, but not our lucky day we may be using an USB storage for a little bit until I get my hands on an SD cards store and get that SSD,
